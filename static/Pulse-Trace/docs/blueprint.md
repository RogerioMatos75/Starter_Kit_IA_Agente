# **App Name**: PulseTrace

## Core Features:

- Animated Bus Effect: Dynamic bus trace animation to simulate energy flow, visualizing data pathways on a chip.
- Customizable Parameters: Adjustable speed and intensity controls for customizing the bus trace effect.
- Chip Layout Definition: Ability to import or define chip layouts using a declarative approach such as SVG, to drive animation paths.
- Color Theme Selection: Color customization options for the bus lines and energy pulses to fit different aesthetic preferences.
- Efficient Rendering: Layered architecture to efficiently render the visual elements on the web page

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Glistening gold (#FFD700) to represent the flow of energy, giving a sense of activity and power.
- Background color: Soft silver (#D3D3D3) emulating the metallic sheen of the bus lines, providing contrast without overwhelming.
- Accent color: Subtle amber (#FFC107) for interactive elements, highlighting key controls.
- Font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font, suitable for UI labels to convey technical information.
- Use clean, vector-based icons to represent controls and settings for the animation effect.
- Arrange controls in a logically grouped manner allowing ease of adjustment to parameters with feedback of changes on chip display.
- Ensure that all transitions and effects provide seamlessness, without being overly distracting. The pulse should be smooth and fluid, enhancing the perception of moving energy.
